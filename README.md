# SeismNet

This project implements a dynamic seismograph network that produces live data which can be inspected through a web dashboard.
Moreover, the data generated by the network is merged by a data flow coming from [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/](USGS), and made available through a telegram bot.


## Structure

- `master_node` Contains code for the central node of the network. It acts as the Telegram bot, IoT gateway to the sensors and HTTP api for registered events.
- `seismograph` Holds the microcontroller code for our custom-made seismograph network.
- `web` Web dashboard to view live data coming in from the sensors.
